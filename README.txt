This is a [very] simple step-by-step guide for you to run your first tasks with partSOM4Grid:

1 - Create a database. You can use the utility “ArtificialDatabase” found in the package partSOM.util (for further information, read the project’s JavaDoc).

2 - Have access to and learn how to submit tasks to an OurGrid broker. You can install one (or the entire grid environment as well) in your machine(s) or use the publicly and easily available Web-based broker on http://portal.ourgrid.org.

3 - Learn how to use and write job description files (.jdf) adapted to your tasks, then submit them using the OurGrid broker. Examples of jdfs can be found at the “jdf” directory.

4 - Check the results and enjoy. ;-)
